# Disney+ Hotstar Clone

## Description

#### What is project?
- This project is a clone of a very famous OTT platform in India. I have tried to create a very detailed clone of the platform. I have used Next.js for the developing the clone of this platform. I have used libraries like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), [Swiperjs](https://swiperjs.com/) and [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp). I have used [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for getting data.

#### Reason to use certain technology
- In the project, I have used Next,js because of its ultimate feature, i.e., Server Side Rendering. And also I wanted to understand How Server Side Rendering as a concept. I used SWR library because to use client side for a certain situations like rendering an individual movie/show detail page at the user's demand (Will Improve). I used Swiperjs to create beautiful sliders as you might have seen on the top of the Homepage. I used Sharp because Nextjs recommended it to use for the Image OptimizationðŸ˜….

#### The problems I faced
- I spend a lot of time exploring the API. It was hard to get the right endpoints for the API to get certian movies/shows. I faced challenges when rendering Images as they were contantly throwing errors. I faced problems in dynamic routing of the app as it was not possible to define the `ids` of all the movies and shows for in the app.
